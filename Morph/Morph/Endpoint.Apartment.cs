#region Description
/* Essentially, an apartment represents a logical memory space on a device.
 * Servlets represent objects within that memory space.
 * 
 * For any remote procedure call, an apartment represents the called endpoint.
 * So, a method call will be sent from an apartment proxy to an apartment, and
 * the method reply will be sent from the apartment to the apartment proxy.
